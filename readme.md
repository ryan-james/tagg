##Welcome to the taggdUp! project! 

When complete, my intention is for this project to be the number one tool for bookmarking (tagging) information, and socially sharing the information among people in your chosen network.


In life, everyone has a multitude of different interests, but most often, there isn't enough time to efficiently research each of those interests. Also, in life, people have friends and associates who are interested in some of the things/topics that they are interested in themselves, and whose opinions they trust enough to be considered as some form of quality control. It is my aim to merge the two, enabling people to access desired content by utilising the searching power of people in their information network, who they trust.

**A brief overview:**

1. A user will find content on a website, blog, media app, etc...
2. They will save the link on taggdUp! and tag it with a revelant tag(s).
3. Another user does the same.
4. The two users are familiar with each other, and would like to have access to the content that the other has taggd.
5. The users can follow each other and are able to choose which of the taggd content they wish to see in their content feed.
6. Both users now have an extended information network - as well as their own taggd content, they also have the taggd content of their 'associate', that they have chosen.
7. Users will be able to make content private, if necessary, and all other small extras you'd expect, blah blah blah...

**Essential EXtras**

1. Content from people you follow ONLY becomes part of your info network. People who follow you won't see this.
2. A user's tags can be rated, to allow people to find others based on the quality of their taggd info.
3. Users can change other people's tags (like wikipedia, for example) to ensure that things are taggd correctly.
4. Multiple tags can be added to content.
